          <p>
            ORCA believes that the only way to protect our whales and dolphins
            is to identify areas where theyâ€™re vulnerable and study their
            habitats. That way, we can protect these places by changing the way
            we use them. That includes shipping, fishing, noise pollution,
            marine litter and more. Best of all, this information can be shared
            and used across the globe. Providing a local solution to a global
            problem.
